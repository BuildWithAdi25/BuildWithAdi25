# 👋 Hi, I'm Aditya Phalke!

🔧 AI Engineer in Progress | MERN Stack Developer | Open Source Explorer  
📚 Learning in Public | Documenting My Dev Journey | 20 y/o Self-Taught Coder

Welcome to my learning-in-public repository!  
I'm actively building strong foundations in **AI Engineering**, **Full-Stack Web Development (MERN)**, and **No-Code Tools** to solve real-world, boring, painful problems using technology.

This repository will document my progress, projects, and resources as I level up in these domains.

## 🎯 Core Learning Tracks

### 1️⃣ AI Engineering

I'm mastering Python and core data science concepts to break into the AI space with confidence.

#### 🧠 Current Focus Areas:
- ✅ Python: Basics → Intermediate → Mastery
- ✅ Libraries: `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`
- ✅ Data Structures & Algorithms (100–150 LeetCode Questions)
- ✅ SQL (following CodeBasics Course)
- ✅ Maths for AI (11th, 12th & Engineering Math)
- ✅ Machine Learning Basics
- ✅ Small AI Projects to apply ML concepts

### 2️⃣ MERN Stack Development

I'm learning modern full-stack development to build real-world applications.

#### 💻 Stack Breakdown:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Other Tools**: Git, GitHub, Postman

#### 🛠 Project Goals:
- Build full-stack projects from scratch
- Practice real use cases (e.g., dashboards, APIs, CRUD apps)
- Deploy and maintain clean, documented codebases on GitHub

### 3️⃣ No-Code Tooling

I'm exploring powerful no-code/low-code tools to quickly build and test product ideas.

#### ⚙️ Tools I'm Learning:
- **Zapier** – Automate repetitive workflows
- **Make (Integromat)** – Visual automation builder
- **Bubble** – No-code web app builder
- **Tally.so** – Simple, beautiful forms
